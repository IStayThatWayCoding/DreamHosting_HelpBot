        "Creating a Database": "• To create a Database, go to the “Databases” tab on your server panel.\n• On the top right, click **NEW DATABASE**\n• Enter a name for your database\n• If you are advanced, feel free to mess around with the **CONNECTIONS FROM** box. If not, leave it blank to allow connections from anywhere.\n• Once created, all information can be seen by clicking the **EYE** icon on the top right of the tab.\n• If you are having trouble, contact us.",
        "Connecting to your Database": "• Head to [pma.dreamhosting.online](http://pma.dreamhosting.online)\n• Click the **EYE** icon to view all info for your database\n• Click the **USERNAME** box to copy your username.\n• Paste it into the **Username** box on the phpMyAdmin site.\n• Follow the same steps for your password. **YOUR PHPMYADMIN PASSWORD IS __NOT__ THE SAME AS YOUR PANEL PASSWORD!**\n• If you cannot connect, please contact us!\n• From there, you can add/delete tables and import/export them.

        "How To: Manage your Files": "Inside your server files are important things such as world data, plugins, and mods. There are a few ways to access your server files:",
        "Method 1: Panel FTP": "Inside of the Dream Hosting panel, you can access your files in the **Files** tab. This is easier if you were to just edit something small in your files, such as a configuration file for a plugin. This is not recommended for bulk uploads, such as plugin files or world files, as the panel does not support bulk uploads.",
        "Method 2: FileZilla (Recommended)": "This method of accessing your files is highly recommended by Dream Hosting. On FileZilla, you can upload many files at the same time. There are a few steps in order to access your files on the program:\n\n• Download FileZilla: [filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org)\n• On your Dream Hosting server panel, click the **Settings** tab. There, you will see **SFTP DETAILS**. Don’t just paste the information in, as it may not work.\n• Enter the following into FileZilla:\n           • **Host:** Enter the **SERVER ADDRESS** on your panel. It may look similar to this: *sftp://node1.dreamhosting.online:2022*\n           • **Username:** Click the **USERNAME** box on your panel to copy and paste.\n           • **Password:** Your panel password\n           • **Port:** Depending on which node you are on, you will have a different port. You can view your port at the __end of your SFTP address.__ \n                        For example: *sftp://node1.dreamhosting.online:*__2022__ *(enter this into FileZilla!)*\n• Click on **Quickconnect** on FileZilla\n• If it doesn’t work, make sure all info is entered correctly\n• For any help, please contact us!\n\nYou may use other FTP programs, like WinSCP. If you use WinSCP, click the green **LAUNCH SFTP** button and it will prompt for your panel password."
